We will cover Multivariable Calculus and Linear\nAlgebra in math. Both are foundations of any scientific method. In addition, we will examine the\nuse of differential equations in modeling and analyzing a problem. In statistics, we will go over\nstandard statistical analysis, analysis of variance, linear and logistic regression. In Linear Algebra,\nwe will examine matrix algebra, special matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and inverse\nmatrices.\nWe will then go through several standard machine learning methods:\n1. Broad Types: Supervised and Unsupervised\n2. Linear and Logistic Regression\n3. Classification methods: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support\n   Vector Machines.\n4. Artificial Neural Networks: Feed Forward network, Convolutional Neural Network,\n   Recurrent Neural Network\n5. Physics Informed Neural Networks and Echo State Networks.\n6. Time Series Methods: LSTM, GRU\n7. Large Language Models and Transformers.\nThese methods will allow us to tackle pretty much any problem in scientific fields, and they also\nform the basis of solving very serious problems like cancer detection to detecting livable\nexoplanets.\nIn individual sessions, students will consult with the instructor and create a project that best\naligns with their interests. It could be in any scientific field. The project should involve one of the\nmachine learning methods applied to study the problem. The student will write up a report/paper\nabout their findings. Preferred writing software is LaTeX for scientific writing, but Word is\nacceptable.
