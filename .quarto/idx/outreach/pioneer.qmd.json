Traditionally, every scientific field has evolved its own methods to\ntackle problems – whether it is modeling and solving differential equations, using statistics, doing\nregression analysis and figure out prominent trends etc. Examples of these methods are found\neverywhere from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and even newer fields\nlike climate analysis, renewable energy systems. With the advent of data driven methods and\nMachine Learning, many of these same methods are merged and most scientific problems are\nnow attacked by employing all these methods in combination.\n\nWe will be using a combination of lecture notes uploaded on the LMS, pen-paper calculations,\nand running Python codes via Jupyter Notebooks. \n\n\nWe will then go through several standard machine learning methods:\n- Broad Types: Supervised and Unsupervised\n- Linear and Logistic Regression\n- Classification methods: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines.\n- Artificial Neural Networks: Feed Forward network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network.\n- Physics Informed Neural Networks and Echo State Networks.\n- Time Series Methods: LSTM, GRU.\n- Large Language Models and Transformers.\n\nThese methods will allow us to tackle pretty much any problem in scientific fields, and they also\nform the basis of solving very serious problems like cancer detection to detecting livable\nexoplanets. In individual sessions, students will consult with the instructor and create a project that best\naligns with their interests. It could be in any scientific field. The project should involve one of the\nmachine learning methods applied to study the problem. The student will write up a report/paper\nabout their findings. Preferred writing software is LaTeX for scientific writing, but Word is\nacceptable. If you want to use LaTeX, I can provide a tutorial on how to use it.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n## Participants: \n\n- Tairan Ma: \"Multimodal Machine Learning for Physiological\nPrivacy Protection in Facial Videos\"\n- Yichen Leng: \"Data Analytics for Speed-Cubing Rankings\"\n- Mohammed Ali: \"Machine Learning for Memristor Networks\"\n- Xiaodan (Amy) He: \"Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial\nExpression Recognition: Analysis of Current CNNs and Integration of AI Enhancement\"\n- Terry Duan: \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Intelligent\nLearning Tools\"\n\n## Syllabus\nProgram Title: Machine Learning applied to Scientific Problems\nPioneer Syllabus\nTerm: Summer 2025\n\nProgram Topic Description: \n\nThis course introduces the students to Machine Learning methods\nto solve scientific problems.
