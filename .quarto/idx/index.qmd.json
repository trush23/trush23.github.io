I have been teaching here since 2011 and have taught close to 8000 students. My primary job is teaching and coordinating undergraduate courses, and training new instructors and teaching assistants. I teach three undergraduate courses per semester (usually fairly large classes). I also do a lot of outreach for high school students, locally, nationally, and internationally. My longtime passion project is to encourage undergrads and high school students in research. I also try to include a short research component in my courses through projects. I am passionate about open-source education and modernizing the mathematics curriculum. \n\nMy research has spanned a number of different fields over the years. My background is in Physics, where I have worked on grvitational waves, pattern formation in nonlinear systems, Bose-Einstein condensation, granular physics, complex fluids, and locomotion of micro-organisms. Recently, I have been interested in the intersection of physics, math, and deep learning. I like to take up small projects, suitable for undergraduates, to investigate deep learning methods and their foundations. \n\nOutside of teaching and research, I am on the scientific advisory board of Synaptrix Labs (https://www.synaptrix-labs.com/). \nSynaprix Labs is a startup created by a former student Aryan Govil. Their vision is to utilize Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) advances to create a wheelchair for ALS patients that can control and direct motion through real-time EEG analysis. \n\n## Education and Certifications\n\nPh.D. in Physics** | Duke University | 2006\n\nM.SC. in Physics** | University of Pune | 1995\n\nB.Sc. in Physics** | University of Mumbai| 1993\n\nCertification: **Applied Data Science (Leveraging AI for Decision Making)**| MIT Professional Education | 2023\n\nCertification: **Data Science and AI Educators’ Program**| Alan Turing Institute, UK | 2023\n\n## Professional Experience\n\n **New York University, Department of Mathematics**\n\n Clinical Associate Professor | Sept 2024 – Present\n\n Clinical Assistant Professor | Sept 2012 – Sept 2024\n\n Visiting Assistant Professor | Sept 2011 – Sept 2012\n\n Courant Instructor / Post-doctoral Scientist | Sept 2009 – Sept 2011\n\n **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**\n\n Post-doctoral Research Fellow, Mechanical Engineering | 2006 – 2009\n\n## News\n\n* **Jan 2026:** I will be teaching Linear Algebra, and two Core classes:  From Data To Discovery and Great Ideas In Mathematics.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Under Construction\nPlease note that I am currently populating the site.
