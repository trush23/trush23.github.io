## Past and Current Research

I have split the "Research" portion into three components. My past research had a different, professional goal. I started off as an experiemntal physicist but I have worked with applied mathematicians and engineers. 

Currently, I am more focused on using research as a teaching tool for undergrads and  high school students. I create appropriate research projects for motivated and sincere students to give them research experience, improve critical thinking skills, and teach them how to explore and investigate a research problem. 

**Recently, I have been exploring problems at the intersection of Math, Physics, and Deep Learning. These topics are timely and particularly suitable for undergrads and high schoolers for short projects.**

## Professional

![Stress Chains in 2d Granular Systems](images/stress_chains.png){fig-align="center"}

My primary area falls broadly under the label of "soft matter physics". I have worked in three different areas: Granular physics (Ph.D.),  Rheology and jetting dynamics of complex fluids, and fluid-structure interactions in the swimming motion of *C. elegans*. 

My Ph.D. was on granular physics. I solved the highly complex and seemingly intractable inverse problem of finding contact forces on particles from photoelastic images. My Ph.D. work was considered groundbreaking, that resulted in my very first publication in *Nature*. A follow up work on jamming in granular media was published in *Physical Review Letters* as a **Cover Article**.

## With High School Students

**Intel Science Competition:**
- Rishad Rahman, Bronx Science High School. Rishad recently graduated from MIT with a major in
  Computer Science.
  Project: Collective locomotion of Euglena Gracialis. We collected data on the swarming behavior of
  Euglena and analyzed the videos to examine the properties of their collective swimming.

- Therese Chan, Bronx Science High School. Therese is currently an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, Com-
  puter Science.
  Project: Automatic detection of force distribution in granular systems - a Matlab implementation. We
  took an existing C code I had written while doing my PH.D. at Duke and converted parts of it in to a
  Matlab code to automate the process of finding contact forces in granular systems.

**GSTEM Program:**

- Sophie Connor, Schoharie High School. Sophie is an undergraduate and a joint Math/CS major at
Dartmouth.
Project: Making Music from Chaos.
We numerically iterated a few one dimensional chaotic maps like the Henon map and the logistic map
and converted the outputs of those maps in diﬀerent behavioral windows like the periodic, quasi-periodic,
chaotic etc. into sounds by using a midi converter.

- Penny Mian, Hicksville Public School. Penny is now at Georgetown University in Chemical Engineering.
Project: Pattern formation in Belusov-Zhabotinsky reaction. We carried out experiments and analyzed
pattern formation in this reaction.

- Aileen Venegas. Aileen is now at George Washington University in Biomedical Engineering.
Project: Network analysis of gene architecture in the chromosome. We analyzed connection network of
gene organization in chromosomes from real experimental data (provided by a collaborator).
