## Past and Current Research

My primary area is soft matter physics. In particular, I have worked on granular physics, complex fluids, and fluid-structure interactions in the swimming locomotion of *C. elegans*. 

**Recently, I have been exploring problems at the intersection of Math, Physics, and Deep Learning. My primary motivation for research is to use it as a teaching tool to introduce undergrads and high school students to critical thinking, research methods, systematic exploration, and science communication.**

More on all of this in a bit...
