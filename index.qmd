## Bio

I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute, New York University. "Clinical" is our designation for Teaching Track faculty. I have been teaching here since 2011 and have taught close to 8000 students. My primary job is teaching and coordinating undergraduate courses, and training new instructors and teaching assistants. I teach three undergraduate courses per semester (usually fairly large classes). I also do a lot of outreach for high school students, locally, nationally, and internationally. My longtime passion project is to encourage undergrads and high school students in research. I also try to include a short research component in my courses through projects. I am passionate about open-source education and modernizing the mathematics curriculum. 

My research has spanned a number of different fields over the years. My background is in Physics, where I have worked on grvitational waves, pattern formation in nonlinear systems, Bose-Einstein condensation, granular physics, complex fluids, and locomotion of micro-organisms. Recently, I have been interested in the intersection of physics, math, and deep learning. I like to take up small projects, suitable for undergraduates, to investigate deep learning methods and their foundations. 

Outside of teaching and research, I am on the scientific advisory board of Synaptrix Labs (https://www.synaptrix-labs.com/). 
Synaprix Labs is a startup created by a former student Aryan Govil. Their vision is to utilize Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) advances to create a wheelchair for ALS patients that can control and direct motion through real-time EEG analysis.
