We will see how from this randomness emerges a regular pattern - the famous “Bell Curve”. We will investigate its uses in different situations.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Let’s see if the following scenario sounds familiar or relatable:\nYou are a current student who realized that you need to learn about Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and AI in general. Maybe you are a mid-career professional who is looking to pivot, realizing the same or maybe you have to learn something about these things because you got “the memo” that you will be working with newly hired AI expert!\nChances are that irrespective of the exact situation, we all end up following a similar plan of action: look at free resources on the internet, Youtube videos, Lecture notes of famous courses, maybe a bootcamp or two, maybe a paid course if you can afford to. After all that, you feel reasonably secure that you know when to apply which method, why different subject areas like computer vision or healthcare require specific methods suited to those areas. You may even attempt to read original research papers on the methods you intend to use. That’s when you start realizing that the entire structure is heavily steeped in Math!\nYou had a feeling about it but you pushed it back to be dealt with later. Now, you start to notice how many people were talking about getting a foundation in math to be able to use ML/DL/AI more effectively and interpret the results properly. So you dust off the old books on calculus, linear algebra, and probability and statistics and repeat the whole cycle mentioned above, but this time for math. How much math you need to do depends on your own individual case. Unless you are a researcher or an engineer tweaking these systems at the fundamental level, you only need an intuitive grasp of the concepts and how they become the foundation of ever complicated architectures.\nFinally, you feel you are set and have a reasonable foundation to build upon and go deeper. As soon as you do that, you encounter technical terms, jargon and concepts that were never explained in any material you studied or any math you learned! You come across terms like ensemble, temperature, entropy, partitions, free energy, attractors, stability, equilibrium, non-equilibrium, diffusion, manifolds, groups, symmetries, eigenspaces, dynamics, variational, renormalization, etc. You may even hear someone mention Ising Model, quantization, or pretty much anything with quantum as a prefix.\nNow you despair that also need to know Physics!\nIt does feel like this whole thing is a bottomless pit but there is a good reason for the need to know a bit of physics. All of the terms I mentioned above and many more are at the foundation of this whole field, starting with neural networks. Most of them are concepts borrowed from Physics and applied to DS/ML/DL/AI. It is a fact that starting with “neurons” in neural networks, a whole bunch of methods, architectures, and protocols are new applications of statistical physics. Occasionally, well-established methods from astronomy and particle physics have also been modified and adapted.\nIt is not so surprising that the Nobel Prize for advances in AI was awarded in the Physics category. Now, it may even be clearer why notable figures like Elon Musk and Jensen Huang have been advocating studying physics.\nI have been observing and thinking about this need to explain the physics that operates behind-the-scenes for a while now. In subsequent posts, I aim to comprehensively explain each and every physics concept that is used in AI. I am not attempting to convert anyone to study physics endlessly or become an expert at it. My goal for this blog is to give you intuitive understanding and sufficient insights so that if someone tries to “blind you with physics”, you can hold your own!\nLet me briefly explain why I think I can do this. Firstly, I love teaching, am passionate about it. Majority of my teaching has been in Math and Physics. I am trained as a soft matter physicist, but at various points in my life, I have worked in astrophysics, nonlinear dynamics and chaos, pattern formation, Bose-Einstein condensation, physics of granular systems, complex fluids, and locomotion of microorganisms. That basically covers the entire length scale, from cosmic scale to quantum scale and the in-between scale.\nI transitioned to a teaching career thirteen years ago. I am a teaching-track math professor at NYU, Courant Institute. I have taught math to an incredibly diverse group of undergraduates. I have taught abstract math concepts to every possible major on campus. I enjoy finding ways to explain and engage students who are usually apprehensive and sometimes terrified of learning math. I plan on bringing the same passion here and to quote Einstein, “Make everything as simple as possible but not simpler.”\nI genuinely hope you enjoy my offering and maybe even get some practical benefit out of it. I know I am going to thoroughly enjoy this new creative outlet."

    "text": "When we think of the world of physics, we usually think either very big, like stars and galaxies, or very small like atoms and molecules. But our everyday experience typically is of things that are somewhere in-between in scale. Think of most objects that we deal with on a daily basis - glassware and salt and pepper, soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, ketchup, etc.. The physics of these kinds of objects and materials is in fact an active area of research and is classified as “soft matter physics”.\nIn this series, we will explore the physics behind a few of these materials.\nFirst, we will see that a simple and ubiquitous material like sand is in fact very complicated and can exhibit puzzling behavior. Sand or anything that is “grainy” (think of nuts and grains in those mini-silos in your supermarket) can show behavior that is solid-like (will stay as is if not disturbed), liquid-like (can be poured) or gas-like (think of sand storms). Physics of grainy materials in each of these states is unique and we will see why they behave the way they do and also why it is important to study such systems (from efficient storage to making the Mars Rover move on Martian sand efficiently).\nNext we will explore the world of strange “liquids”. We know what we mean when we think of liquids - things that are like water, can be poured, if poured, it flows away etc. But how about mayonnaise, ketchup, or even toothpaste? Should they be considered liquids? Or are they somewhere between solids and liquids. These kinds of unusual fluids, where a simple liquid is mixed-in with some other “stuff” are known as “complex fluids”. It is this mix of different things in them that gives rise to unusual properties they show. [cite_start]We will see what those properties are and how to understand their behavior.\nFinally, we will explore the emerging field of creating new materials and artificial machines inspired by nature. For example, what allows a gecko to crawl vertically up? How do we make super light and yet super strong material like spider silk. Can we create tiny nano-bots that can be programmed and injected in our body to perform repairs to injuries and heal diseases? [cite_start]We will explore cutting edge research on many such new inventions."

I have been teaching here since 2011 and have taught close to 8000 students. My primary job is teaching and coordinating undergraduate courses, and training new instructors and teaching assistants. I teach three undergraduate courses per semester (usually fairly large classes). I also do a lot of outreach for high school students, locally, nationally, and internationally. My longtime passion project is to encourage undergrads and high school students in research. I also try to include a short research component in my courses through projects. I am passionate about open-source education and modernizing the mathematics curriculum.\nMy research has spanned a number of different fields over the years. My background is in Physics, where I have worked on grvitational waves, pattern formation in nonlinear systems, Bose-Einstein condensation, granular physics, complex fluids, and locomotion of micro-organisms. Recently, I have been interested in the intersection of physics, math, and deep learning. I like to take up small projects, suitable for undergraduates, to investigate deep learning methods and their foundations.\nOutside of teaching and research, I am on the scientific advisory board of Synaptrix Labs. Synaprix Labs is a startup created by a former student Aryan Govil. Their vision is to utilize Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) advances to create a wheelchair for ALS patients that can control and direct motion through real-time EEG analysis."

    "text": "Syllabus\nProgram Title: Machine Learning applied to Scientific Problems Pioneer Syllabus Term: Summer 2025\nProgram Topic Description:\nThis course introduces the students to Machine Learning methods to solve scientific problems. Traditionally, every scientific field has evolved its own methods to tackle problems – whether it is modeling and solving differential equations, using statistics, doing regression analysis and figure out prominent trends etc. Examples of these methods are found everywhere from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and even newer fields like climate analysis, renewable energy systems. With the advent of data driven methods and Machine Learning, many of these same methods are merged and most scientific problems are now attacked by employing all these methods in combination.\nWe will be using a combination of lecture notes uploaded on the LMS, pen-paper calculations, and running Python codes via Jupyter Notebooks.\nWe will then go through several standard machine learning methods:\n\nBroad Types: Supervised and Unsupervised\nLinear and Logistic Regression\nClassification methods: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines.\nArtificial Neural Networks: Feed Forward network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network.\nPhysics Informed Neural Networks and Echo State Networks.\nTime Series Methods: LSTM, GRU.\nLarge Language Models and Transformers.\n\nThese methods will allow us to tackle pretty much any problem in scientific fields, and they also form the basis of solving very serious problems like cancer detection to detecting livable exoplanets. In individual sessions, students will consult with the instructor and create a project that best aligns with their interests. It could be in any scientific field. The project should involve one of the machine learning methods applied to study the problem. The student will write up a report/paper about their findings. Preferred writing software is LaTeX for scientific writing, but Word is acceptable. If you want to use LaTeX, I can provide a tutorial on how to use it."
