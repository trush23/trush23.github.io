## Project Overview

Starting Fall 2025, as a part of the working group headed by Prof. Rohini Qamra, I learned about the CURE framework and discussed ways to implement it in math courses. It is a challenging proposition to incorporate full CURE framework for a typical math course with 120 students. In Fall, I did a soft version in Linear Algebra with Applications via coding projects at the end of the semester. In Spring 20206, I plan to implement a similar project-based learning in both of the Core classes I am teaching: From data To Discovery and Great Ideas In Mathematics. 


### Key Objectives
* Incorporate Reserach component in traditional courses.
* Encourage curiosity, exploration, and understanding.
* Give students a taste of what research is like.
* Build skills like critical thinking, teamwork, and research mindset.
