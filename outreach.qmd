I regularly give talks at high school, create research projects with high school students, and lead math events for the local community. I also give public lectures at the New York Public Library, collaborate as a mentor with New York Academy of Sciences, Pioneer Academy, and Center for Mathematical Talent. Several high school students I have done research projects with, have been semi finalists in the INTEL Science Competition. 

* ArchaeoHack (2025): Mentor and judge for the inaugural ArchaeoHack 2025. The topic was to create an app that recognizes Egyptian Hieroglyphs as images or sketched by hand.

* CSPLASH (2021 onwards): Organized annual day-long event for highschool students; talks by faculty, lab visits, and games. 

* Girls in STEM (GSTEM): A Courant Institute Summer research program for female high school students in the US. Participated as research mentor in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016.

* New York Public Library (NYPL): Gave two lecture series (5 lectures each) at the Jefferson Branch. (Spring 2016) Mathematical Patterns In Nature, (Fall 2016) Physics of Everyday Things.

* New York Academy of Sciences (NYAS) 2017-2021: 

   + Global Science Academy: As a research mentor, I mentored research team composed of high      school students around the world on research projects (online).

   + Scientist-In-Residence: Mentored 7th and 8th grade classes in New York Public Schools on research projects for one semester. PS-181 in Fall 2017 and PS-151 in Fall 2018

* NYU-ABU DHABI: Mentoring and teaching talented Emerati high school students in Abu Dhabi (Summer 2017) 

* Center for Mathematical Talent: Lecture Series on Graph Theory for talented high school students (2016, 2018, 2020, 2022)
