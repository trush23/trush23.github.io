## Syllabus
Program Title: Machine Learning applied to Scientific Problems
Pioneer Syllabus
Term: Summer 2025
Program Topic Description: This course introduces the students to Machine Learning methods
to solve scientific problems. Traditionally, every scientific field has evolved its own methods to
tackle problems – whether it is modeling and solving differential equations, using statistics, doing
regression analysis and figure out prominent trends etc. Examples of these methods are found
everywhere from physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and even newer fields
like climate analysis, renewable energy systems. With the advent of data driven methods and
Machine Learning, many of these same methods are merged and most scientific problems are
now attacked by employing all these methods in combination.
We will be using a combination of lecture notes uploaded on the LMS, pen-paper calculations,
and running Python codes via Jupyter Notebooks. The students are requested to install Anaconda
or VSCode to run Python codes. Instructions on downloading and installing anaconda will be
provided by the instructor and you will be guided through the process if necessary.
We will begin our study with a basic review of mathematics and statistics needed to approach
any scientific problem and Machine Learning. We will cover Multivariable Calculus and Linear
Algebra in math. Both are foundations of any scientific method. In addition, we will examine the
use of differential equations in modeling and analyzing a problem. In statistics, we will go over
standard statistical analysis, analysis of variance, linear and logistic regression. In Linear Algebra,
we will examine matrix algebra, special matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and inverse
matrices.
We will then go through several standard machine learning methods:
1. Broad Types: Supervised and Unsupervised
2. Linear and Logistic Regression
3. Classification methods: Decision Trees, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support
   Vector Machines.
4. Artificial Neural Networks: Feed Forward network, Convolutional Neural Network,
   Recurrent Neural Network
5. Physics Informed Neural Networks and Echo State Networks.
6. Time Series Methods: LSTM, GRU
7. Large Language Models and Transformers.
These methods will allow us to tackle pretty much any problem in scientific fields, and they also
form the basis of solving very serious problems like cancer detection to detecting livable
exoplanets.
In individual sessions, students will consult with the instructor and create a project that best
aligns with their interests. It could be in any scientific field. The project should involve one of the
machine learning methods applied to study the problem. The student will write up a report/paper
about their findings. Preferred writing software is LaTeX for scientific writing, but Word is
acceptable. If you want to use LaTeX, I can provide a tutorial on how to use it.
